# Employee Background Verification
This project aims to reduce fraud by completing background checks prior to employment and ongoing throughout an individual's employment. Background checks used in the recruiting process can shield the business against lawsuits alleging negligent hiring in the future, protect its assets and reputation, and give present employees a sense of security at work. Due to these factors, as well as the fact that it can be challenging to confirm the information on a CV in today's fast-paced and globalized world, background checks are a crucial step in the recruiting process at many businesses. It is possible to lessen the risks associated with hiring and onboarding workers who have altered wage slips and forged educational credentials.

# Introduction
Any employer will investigate an applicant's background after an interview. Background checks used in the recruiting process can shield the business against lawsuits alleging negligent hiring in the future, protect its assets and reputation, and give present employees a sense of security at work. Background checks are a crucial component of many firms' recruiting processes because of these factors, as well as the fact that it can be challenging to verify the information on a CV in today's fast-paced and globally connected world.

Employers frequently request background checks from prospective candidates as part of the employment screening process, particularly from those looking for employment within a firm. Performance in the past is a solid indicator of future success. Title, tenure, pay claims, reasons for leaving, and rehire eligibility are all confirmed through an employment background check. Problematic areas might become apparent. The Employment History Verification report aids in determining whether the applicant possesses the work history and experience required for the position. Additionally, it gives previous employers a chance to express what they thought of the candidate as an employee.

# Existing System
In larger businesses, references or background checks are typically conducted by other parties. A third party is given the duty of employee verification. They compile the data from the employee's CV, check the specifics, and confirm his academic history, prior employer, designation, income, etc. They then generate a report. The company received this report and as a result, a corporation will make additional decisions.

Verification by a third party is a costly and time-consuming process, and it is also possible that the data they gathered was inaccurate. Additionally, a background check is only conducted once a candidate has been chosen based on an interview. The hiring process will need to start over if the background check yields negative results because many businesses may only interview their top pick or a small selection of candidates. Any errors made by the third party could result in significant issues for both the company and the employee, issues that might be challenging to fix.

# Proposed System
We suggest a new phrase, "pre-employment background check," which refers to a verification of an applicant's background before the hiring process even begins. The main benefit is that it lessens the likelihood of a hiring catastrophe. A pre-background check may show that the applicant is using a fake identity to apply for jobs. A preliminary background check confirms that the applicant actually attended the institutions stated on his resume and that any degrees and licenses he claims to have earned are accurate. Additionally, it confirms details about his prior employment, including whether or not he worked there, how long he did, how satisfied his employers were with his performance, his job title, his pay, and any career advancements.

As a consolidated system, this initiative serves both employers and employees. The information about a newly registered firm must be posted on this website. The company should upload information about each employee, including name, contact information, family information, education information, and documentation that enables us to uniquely identify that employee across the nation (e.g., voter ID or Aadhar card number), work experience, salary information, employee performance, department and domain in which the employee is employed, employee status (i.e., still working or left), and the creation of a Unique Employ Number. If an employee is applying for a new position, he must include his Unique Employer Number in his résumé together with information about his experience, or else he will be considered a fresher. Candidates will submit their resumes to employers in response to their requests for applications for open positions. Utilizing his Unique Employer Number, the company will investigate an applicant's background before to having an interview. If the company is pleased with the applicant's background, it will schedule and notify the applicant of the interview date. The firm may make a comment on the employee profile if there is any fraud in the resume of an employee.

A comprehensive investigation deters fakers, who might withdraw to avoid embarrassment, and exposes dishonest candidates who decide to brag it out. A background check can protect your the business from a lawsuit for negligent hiring by eliminating candidates with a violent or drug-using past. However, it is essential that background check is performed carefully because many parts of employee privacy are protected by law and may risk facing legal repercussions if it violates an applicant's rights. The firm may make a comment on the employee profile if there is any fraud in the resume of an employee. When registering, employees can add both their personal information and their job history.

# Conclusion
This project is extremely beneficial to the entire firm. Once logged in, a corporation can easily undertake background checks on its personnel. We avoid spending money and effort on background checks. Every time a new employee joins, his CV's information is checked on this website using his unique identity number. If we enter a new employee's unique identity number on the website, the number will be accepted. If the applicant has experience, the website already displays the information about previous job. By constant use of our website, we are successful in achieving the accurate result.

# Future Scope
The firm can view the salary and personal information of an employee in this project. In the future, we can improve this project by adding a checkbox that allows employees to authorize employers to read information about prior jobs. Employee can play a variety of roles if treated like an actor. By giving the employee the chance to provide feedback, we can further improve the usability.
